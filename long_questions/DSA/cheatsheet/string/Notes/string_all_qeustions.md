Got it 👍 You want to **master string-based problem solving in Go**, especially from an **Indian interview perspective**. That’s a smart focus—strings are *guaranteed* interview territory.

Below is a **curated, interview-grade list of string problem statements**, covering **all major patterns** asked in **Indian product & service companies** (FAANG, Flipkart, Swiggy, Zomato, Paytm, Infosys, TCS, Wipro, etc.).

I’ve grouped them by **concept**, so you can crack them *systematically*, not randomly.

## 1️⃣ String Basics (Warm-up but mandatory)

These are often used to test fundamentals + Go string handling.

1. Reverse a string
2. Check if a string is a palindrome
3. Count vowels and consonants in a string
4. Remove spaces from a string
5. Find length of a string without using `len()`
6. Convert lowercase to uppercase and vice versa
7. Check if two strings are equal without using built-in comparison
8. Count number of words in a string

👉 **Indian interview trick**: They may ask you to handle **Unicode (runes)** properly in Go.

## 2️⃣ Frequency & Hashing Based Problems (VERY COMMON)

These are *must-do* for interviews.

1. Find the **first non-repeating character** in a string
2. Find all **duplicate characters** in a string
3. Count frequency of each character
4. Check if two strings are **anagrams**
5. Find the **most frequent character**
6. Remove duplicate characters from a string
7. Print characters with their frequencies in sorted order

💡 Key Go skill: `map[rune]int`

## 3️⃣ Substring & Sliding Window (High-paying companies love this)

These problems separate average from strong candidates.

1. Find the **longest substring without repeating characters**
2. Find the **longest palindromic substring**
3. Count number of substrings with all distinct characters
4. Find all anagrams of a pattern in a string
5. Smallest window containing all characters of another string
6. Check if a string contains all characters of another string

🔥 Asked in: Amazon, Flipkart, Microsoft India

## 4️⃣ Palindrome-Based Problems (Classic Interview Favorite)

1. Check if string is palindrome (ignore spaces & cases)
2. Longest palindromic substring
3. Count palindromic substrings
4. Check if string can be rearranged to form a palindrome
5. Minimum deletions to make string palindrome

---

## 5️⃣ String Transformation & Manipulation

1. Reverse words in a sentence
2. Capitalize first letter of each word
3. Remove all adjacent duplicates
4. Replace characters with their occurrence count
5. String compression (e.g. `aaabb → a3b2`)
6. Rotate string left or right by K positions
7. Check if one string is rotation of another

---

## 6️⃣ Pattern Matching & Searching

1. Implement `strStr()` (substring search)
2. Naive pattern matching
3. Implement **KMP Algorithm**
4. Implement **Rabin-Karp Algorithm**
5. Count occurrences of a pattern in a string

📌 Even if not fully coded, **knowing KMP logic** is expected.

---

## 7️⃣ Interview-Trick Questions (Indian Companies LOVE these)

1. Print all permutations of a string
2. Find lexicographically smallest string after operations
3. Check if string follows a given pattern
4. Group anagrams together
5. Check if string is a valid shuffle of two strings
6. Check balanced parentheses (`(){}[]`)
7. Decode encoded string (`3[a2[c]] → accaccacc`)

---

## 8️⃣ Go-Specific String Interview Questions

These are asked to test **language depth**.

1. Difference between `string` and `[]byte`
2. Why strings are immutable in Go
3. How to efficiently modify strings in Go
4. How to handle Unicode characters in strings
5. Performance comparison: `strings.Builder` vs `+` operator
6. Convert string to rune slice and vice versa

---

## 9️⃣ Real Interview Style Questions (India)

1. Given a log string, find the most frequent error code
2. Validate email or password string
3. Mask sensitive data (credit card, phone number)
4. Autocomplete suggestion using prefix
5. Find longest common prefix among strings

---

## 🔟 How to Practice (IMPORTANT)

To **crack interviews**, do this:

✅ Solve each problem in:

* **Brute force**
* **Optimized approach**
* **Explain time & space complexity**

✅ Always think:

* ASCII vs Unicode
* `rune` vs `byte`
* Edge cases (empty string, single char)
