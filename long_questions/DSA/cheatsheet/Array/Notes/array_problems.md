Got it 👍 You want to **master array-based problem solving in Golang**, specifically from an **Indian interview perspective**. Great goal — arrays are *absolute fundamentals* in India-based tech interviews (product + service companies).

Below is a **well-structured, interview-focused roadmap** with **problem statements only** (so you can practice properly), ordered from **basic → advanced**, exactly how interview prep should be done.

---

## 1️⃣ Basic Array Problems (Warm-up – must be perfect)

These are expected to be solved **without hesitation**.

1. Find the **largest and smallest element** in an array
2. Reverse an array **in-place**
3. Find the **second largest element**
4. Check if an array is **sorted**
5. Count **even and odd elements**
6. Remove **duplicate elements** from a sorted array
7. Left rotate an array by **1 position**
8. Left rotate an array by **K positions**
9. Find the **sum of all elements**
10. Find the **frequency of each element**

💡 *Indian interviews often ask these to check basics + Go slice handling.*

---

## 2️⃣ Searching & Index-Based Problems

Focus here on **edge cases and time complexity**.

1. Linear search in an array
2. Binary search (iterative & recursive)
3. Find **first and last occurrence** of an element
4. Count occurrences of a number in a sorted array
5. Find a **missing number** in range `1…N`
6. Find the element that appears **only once** (others appear twice)
7. Find the **peak element**

---

These test **logic + optimization**.

1. Find all **pairs with a given sum**
2. Find all **triplets with a given sum**
3. Find the **majority element** (appears > n/2 times)
4. Find **leaders** in an array
5. Find the **equilibrium index**
6. Find the **maximum difference** such that `j > i`
7. Check if array elements are **consecutive**
8. Find the **duplicate number** (without modifying array)

---

## 5️⃣ Prefix Sum & Hashing Based Problems

Used heavily to test **optimization skills**.

1. Range sum queries using prefix sum
2. Find subarray with **sum = 0**
3. Count subarrays with **sum = K**
4. Find longest subarray with **distinct elements**
5. Check if there exists a subarray with **given XOR**
6. Find number of subarrays with **equal number of odd and even elements**

---

## 6️⃣ Sorting-Based Interview Problems

Sorting + logic = classic Indian interview combo.

1. Merge two sorted arrays
2. Find the **median of two sorted arrays**
3. Sort array by **frequency**
4. Minimum number of swaps to sort the array
5. Find **inversion count**
6. Chocolate distribution problem
7. Arrange array to form **largest number**

---

## 7️⃣ Advanced / Product Company Level (Amazon, Flipkart, Swiggy, etc.)

These separate **average vs strong** candidates.

1. Maximum product subarray
2. Trapping rain water
3. Container with most water
4. Subarray sum divisible by K
5. Maximum circular subarray sum
6. Longest consecutive sequence
7. Count smaller elements on right side
8. Stock buy and sell (all variations)

---

## 8️⃣ Golang-Specific Expectations (Important!)

While solving in Go, interviewers expect:

* Proper use of **slices**
* No unnecessary memory allocation
* Clean loops (`for`, no fancy tricks)
* Handling **empty slices and edge cases**
* Time complexity explanation

Example questions they *love* asking:

* Why slice length vs capacity matters?
* In-place vs extra space solution?
* How Go handles array vs slice internally?

Let’s crack it 💪🔥



Love that mindset 👌 — *that* itself is a good problem-solving attitude.

Here’s the **remaining 5%**: the **rare, tricky, and interviewer-favorite edge-case array problems** that **separate “good” from “very strong” candidates** in Indian interviews.

Think of this as the **finishing polish list** ✨

## 🔥 The Final 5% Array Problem List (Interview Edge-Case Killers)

### 1️⃣ Tricky Edge-Case Arrays

These test **attention to detail**, not just logic.

1. Find the **minimum length unsorted subarray** that makes the whole array sorted
2. Check if array can be sorted by **only one swap**
3. Check if array can be sorted by **only reversing one subarray**
4. Find the **first missing positive integer**
5. Find the smallest positive number **missing from array**
6. Find the element which appears **more than n/k times**
7. Find the maximum sum such that **no two elements are adjacent**
8. Find if there exists a **subarray with sum = 0** (without extra space if possible)

---

### 2️⃣ Observation-Heavy Problems (Brain Test)

Interviewers ask these to see **thinking clarity**.

1. Find the element with **maximum repeating count** in O(n) time
2. Rearrange array such that `arr[i] = i` if possible
3. Find if array is **good** (can be made equal by operations)
4. Maximum length bitonic subarray
5. Minimum operations to make array **palindrome**
6. Find the longest alternating even-odd subarray

---

### 3️⃣ Constraint-Driven Problems (Optimization Focus)

They’ll change constraints mid-interview 😈

1. Find duplicate in array of size `n+1` with elements `1..n`
   (no extra space, no modification)
2. Find missing and repeating number
3. Find maximum sum subarray **with at least K elements**
4. Subarray with equal number of 0s, 1s, and 2s
5. Find count of subarrays whose **product < K**

---

### 4️⃣ Interview “Twist” Questions

They look simple, but they’re not.

1. Rotate array **without using extra space**
2. Find K-th smallest element **without sorting**
3. Find median of a stream of numbers (array based)
4. Partition array into 3 parts with equal sum
5. Minimum jumps to reach end of array
6. Find if array can be divided into **pairs divisible by K**

---

### 5️⃣ Real Interview Follow-ups (Very Important)

These are often asked **after** you solve the main problem.

1. Can you do it **in-place**?
2. Can you reduce space complexity?
3. What happens for **empty / single element array**?
4. How will your solution change if data is **streaming**?
5. Can you generalize this solution?
6. What breaks if constraints increase?

---

## ⚠️ Why this 5% matters

* These problems:

  * Expose weak edge-case handling
  * Test patience and calmness
  * Check if you truly *understand* patterns
* Most candidates panic here
  → You won’t, if you practice them.

---

## ✅ Final Reality Statement (No Sugarcoating)

If you master:

* 95% core problems
* * this **5% finishing list**

👉 You are **interview-ready for arrays** in Indian companies.

No exaggeration.
