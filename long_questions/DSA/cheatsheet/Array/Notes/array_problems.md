Got it 👍 You want to **master array-based problem solving in Golang**, specifically from an **Indian interview perspective**. Great goal — arrays are *absolute fundamentals* in India-based tech interviews (product + service companies).

Below is a **well-structured, interview-focused roadmap** with **problem statements only** (so you can practice properly), ordered from **basic → advanced**, exactly how interview prep should be done.

### 5️⃣ Real Interview Follow-ups (Very Important)

These are often asked **after** you solve the main problem.

1. Can you do it **in-place**?
2. Can you reduce space complexity?
3. What happens for **empty / single element array**?
4. How will your solution change if data is **streaming**?
5. Can you generalize this solution?
6. What breaks if constraints increase?

---

## ⚠️ Why this 5% matters

* These problems:

  * Expose weak edge-case handling
  * Test patience and calmness
  * Check if you truly *understand* patterns
* Most candidates panic here
  → You won’t, if you practice them.

## ✅ Final Reality Statement (No Sugarcoating)

If you master:

* 95% core problems
* * this **5% finishing list**

👉 You are **interview-ready for arrays** in Indian companies.

No exaggeration.
