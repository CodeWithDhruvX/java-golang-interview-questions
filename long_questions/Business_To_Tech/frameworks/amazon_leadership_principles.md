## Overview
While specific to Amazon, these 16 principles are widely admired and used as a benchmark for behavioral interviews at many top tech companies. You should prepare 1-2 stories for each grouping.

## 1. Customer Obsession
**Definition**: Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust.
*   *Keywords*: "Customer Trust", "Working Backwards", "Customer Feedback".
*   *Question*: "Tell me about a time you dealt with a difficult customer."

## 2. Ownership
**Definition**: Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They never say "that's not my job".
*   *Keywords*: "Long term", "Responsibility", "Not my job".
*   *Question*: "Tell me about a time you took on a task that was outside your job description."

**Definition**: Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify.
*   *Keywords*: "Innovation", "Simplify", "Automation".
*   *Question*: "Tell me about a time you simplified a complex process."

## 4. Are Right, A Lot
**Definition**: Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
*   *Keywords*: "Judgment", "Instincts", "Mistake".
*   *Question*: "Tell me about a time you made a decision without enough data."

*   *Keywords*: "Quality", "Standards", "Reviews".
*   *Question*: "Tell me about a time you refused to compromise on quality."

*   *Keywords*: "Vision", "Scale", "Bold".
*   *Question*: "Tell me about a time you proposed a bold new initiative."

*   *Question*: "Tell me about a deep dive analysis you performed."

## 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
**Definition**: Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
*   *Keywords*: "Disagreement", "Challenge", "Commitment".
