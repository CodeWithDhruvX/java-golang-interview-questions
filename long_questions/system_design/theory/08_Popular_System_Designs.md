### 71. Design YouTube
"I'd start by clarifying scale: 2 billion logged-in users per month, 500 hours of video uploaded every minute, billions of views per day.

The core flows are **upload** and **stream**. For upload: user uploads raw video to object storage (S3 GCS) via a presigned URL → an upload completion event triggers a Transcoding pipeline → the video is encoded into multiple formats and resolutions (360p, 720p, 1080p, 4K) and stored in CDN-backed object storage. For streaming: user requests a video → CDN serves the chunks (HLS/DASH segments) from the nearest edge node.

The metadata DB (video title, description, tags, likes, views) goes to a relational DB (MySQL). Search is powered by Elasticsearch. The recommendation engine is a separate ML system."

YouTube system deep dive:
```
User → Upload Service → Raw Video (S3)
                ↓ event
            Transcoding Workers (Zookeeper-coordinated)
                ↓ produces
         [360p, 720p, 1080p, 4K] segments → S3 → CDN

User → API Server → Metadata DB (MySQL/Spanner)
                 → CDN URL for video chunks
User → CDN Edge → Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (HLS/DASH)
```

Key design decisions:
- **Transcoding at scale:** YouTube uses a distributed ffmpeg-based pipeline. Video is chunked (1-minute segments) and transcoded in parallel across hundreds of workers. Zookeeper coordinates work assignment. Output: multiple resolution variants as HLS `.m3u8` manifest + `.ts` segment files.
- **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR):** Player monitors network bandwidth and switches quality in real-time. Poor network → 360p. Fast WiFi → 1080p. This is why YouTube rarely buffers.
- **View Count at scale:** Views counter can't do an increment per view on a DB row — at billions/day, that's a hot row problem. Solution: counts are stored in Redis (fast in-memory INCR), batch-flushed to DB every few minutes.
- **Storage cost optimization:** Store originals in cold storage (S3 Glacier), hot serving via CDN. Most videos are long-tail (rarely watched) → CDN doesn't cache them → cheap cold storage serves them on cache miss.

### 72. Design WhatsApp
"WhatsApp serves 2 billion users sending 100 billion messages/day. The core MVP: send a message from User A to User B, deliver it, and show delivery/read receipts.

The key architectural decision is the connection model. WhatsApp maintains a **persistent WebSocket connection** from each client to a server. Messages are sent over this connection — no polling. When User A sends to User B: A sends message to its WebSocket server → server looks up which server B is connected to (via a routing table in Cassandra) → forwards message to B's server → B's server pushes to B.

If B is offline: the message is stored in a Cassandra mailbox. When B comes online and connects, the server delivers queued messages."

#### 🏢 Company Context
**Level:** 🔴 Senior | **Asked at:** Meta (they own WhatsApp!), Amazon, Google — messaging system design

#### Indepth
WhatsApp architecture deep dive:
- **Connection Layer:** Millions of long-lived TCP connections. Erlang/BEAM VM is famous for handling millions of concurrent lightweight processes — this is why WhatsApp built on Erlang. Go is another choice.
- **Message routing:** A consistent-hash ring determines which server any user is "homed" to. Other servers forwards messages to the home server. Redis/ZooKeeper tracks which server each user is connected to.
- **Message storage:** Messages stored in user's device (local SQLite DB). Servers store messages only until delivered. After delivery, server deletes them (privacy by design). Media goes to BLOB storage (CDN).
- **End-to-End Encryption (E2E):** Signal Protocol. Uses X3DH (Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman) key agreement and Double Ratchet for forward secrecy. WhatsApp's server never has the decryption keys.
- **Delivery receipts:** One tick = sent to server. Two ticks = delivered to device. Blue ticks = read. Each acknowledgment is a protocol message flowing back through the WebSocket connection.
- **Group Messaging:** For groups, sender's server expands the recipient list and sends individual messages to each member's server. WhatsApp groups cap at 1024 members to control fan-out cost.

### 73. Design Twitter (X)
"Twitter serves 200M DAU, 500M tweets/day. The hard problem is the **News Feed / Timeline** — each user follows hundreds of accounts; when they open Twitter, they need to see a ranked feed of recent tweets from followed accounts.

Two approaches: **Pull (fan-out on read)** — when user opens Twitter, query tweets from all followed users + rank + serve. Too slow for users following 1000+ accounts. **Push (fan-out on write)** — when a tweet is posted, push it to all followers' pre-computed timeline caches. Near-instant feed load. Problem: celebrities (Justin Bieber, 100M followers) → every tweet triggers 100M cache writes. Twitter uses a **hybrid approach**: regular users get fan-out on write to Redis timeline caches. Celebrity tweets are NOT pushed; they're fetched on read and merged with the pre-computed cache."

#### 🏢 Company Context
**Level:** 🔴 Senior | **Asked at:** Twitter/X (their actual system), Meta, LinkedIn, any social platform company

#### Indepth
Twitter timeline system:
```
Tweet Posted by @justinbieber (100M followers)
      ↓
  Fan-out service
      ↓
 [Regular followers (10K)]: write tweet ID to each user's Redis timeline list
 [Celebrity followers]: Skip — too expensive
      
User opens Twitter:
  1. Fetch their pre-computed Redis timeline (push-model tweets)
  2. Fetch latest tweets from followed celebrities (pull-model)
  3. Merge and rank (by time + engagement score)
  4. Return sorted feed
```

Storage:
- **Tweets:** MySQL (sharded by tweet_id). Tweet IDs are Snowflake IDs (Twitter's distributed ID generation: 41 bits timestamp + 10 bits machine + 12 bits sequence → unique, time-sortable, distributed).
- **Social graph (follows):** Cassandra (user_id → list of followed user_ids) — wide-column is perfect for this.
- **Timelines:** Redis lists — `LPUSH timeline:{user_id} tweet_id`. `LRANGE timeline:{user_id} 0 799` to fetch last 800 tweets for ranking.
- **Search:** Elasticsearch with inverted index on tweet text. Twitter's real-time search requires near-instant indexing (tweets appear in search in <15 seconds).

### 74. Design Uber
"Uber's core challenge: match a rider with the nearest available driver in real-time, across millions of concurrent users globally.

The key data: driver locations update every 5 seconds. With 1M active drivers, that's 200K location updates/second. These can't go to a relational DB directly — too many writes. They go to a **geo-spatial hash** system (S2 cells or Geohash) backed by Redis.

When a rider requests a ride: find all drivers within a radius → rank by ETA (not just distance) → send the request to the top-ranked driver → if they decline, try next. This matching must happen in <1 second."

#### 🏢 Company Context
**Level:** 🔴 Senior | **Asked at:** Uber, Lyft, Ola, Porter, Rapido

#### Indepth
Uber's architecture layers:
1. **Location Service:** Drivers send GPS updates every 5s via WebSocket. Location writes go to Redis geo index (`GEOADD drivers_online lng lat driver_id`). Redis Geo commands give nearby drivers within radius efficiently.
2. **Geospatial Indexing:** Redis uses Sorted Sets with Geohash-based scores. `GEORADIUSBYMEMBER drivers_online current_driver 5 km ASC COUNT 10` returns nearest 10 drivers.
3. **Matching Service:** Scoring function: `score = f(distance, driver_rating, surge_multiplier, ETA)`. Uber H3 hexagonal grid (by Uber H3 library) divides the earth into hierarchical hexagonal cells. Queries are cell-based — "drivers in current cell + neighboring cells".
4. **Surge Pricing:** Computed dynamically by comparing supply (available drivers) vs demand (pending ride requests) per H3 cell. Published to all apps in real-time.
5. **Trip Lifecycle:** State machine — `REQUESTED → DRIVER_ASSIGNED → DRIVER_ARRIVED → TRIP_STARTED → TRIP_ENDED → PAYMENT_PROCESSED`. Each state transition published as Kafka event.

### 75. Design Instagram
"Instagram: photo/video sharing. 1 billion MAU (Monthly Active Users), hundreds of millions of photos uploaded daily.

The core flows: upload media → process (filter, resize, CDN) → post to followers' feeds. The bottleneck is the feed: generating a personalized, ranked feed for a billion users.

Infrastructure: media uploaded to S3 → Lambda triggers resize pipeline → multiple sizes (thumbnail, low-res, full) stored back to S3 → CloudFront CDN serves globally. Feed generation: Instagram uses a trained ranking ML model that scores candidate posts by predicted engagement. The candidate pool is pulled from followed accounts' recent posts."

#### 🏢 Company Context
**Level:** 🔴 Senior | **Asked at:** Meta, Snap, Pinterest, Twitter

#### Indepth
Instagram infrastructure highlights:
- **Photos → Cassandra:** Photo metadata (photo_id, user_id, caption, timestamp, location) stored in Cassandra — write-heavy, no complex joins needed.
- **Follower graph → Cassandra:** `user_id → [follower_ids]` and `user_id → [following_ids]`. Wide rows perfect for Cassandra.
- **Feed (original implementation):** Pure fan-out on write as Instagram scaled. When User A posts, a Celery task pushes `photo_id` to each follower's Redis feed list. For Instagram at early scale (~millions of users), this was manageable.
- **Feed (current):** Hybrid approach with ML ranking. Ranker uses signals: recency, engagement prediction, relationship strength, content type. Hundreds of features processed by a neural network ranking model.
- **Stories:** 24-hour TTL. Stored in Cassandra with TTL column. No need for explicit deletion — Cassandra handles TTL natively.
- **Instagram's original LAMP stack → evolved to Python (Django) services + PostgreSQL + Redis + Cassandra** — classic startup scale-up story.

### 76. Design a URL Shortener (like bit.ly)
"A URL shortener: input `https://very-long-url.com/page?params=many` → output `https://sho.rt/abc123`. Requirements: 100M URLs stored, 10B redirects/day (high read, low write).

The core service: **encode** input URL → **store** mapping in DB → **redirect** short URL to original. The shortcode generation is the key design decision. I use **Base62 encoding** (a-z A-Z 0-9 = 62 chars). A 6-character Base62 code gives 62^6 = ~56 billion unique codes. Generate a new auto-incrementing numeric ID, convert to Base62.

The redirect is a `301 Redirect` (permanent, browser caches) or `302 Redirect` (temporary, server handles every hit — needed for analytics)."

#### 🏢 Company Context
**Level:** 🟡 Mid – 🔴 Senior | **Asked at:** Amazon, Google, Flipkart — classic beginner-friendly system design question with depth in scalability discussion

#### Indepth
URL shortener design decisions:

**Encoding approaches:**
1. **Counter + Base62:** Monotonically increasing DB auto-increment ID → convert to Base62. Cons: predictable sequence, reveals approximate creation order.
2. **MD5/SHA256 hash + truncate:** Take first 6 chars of hash. Cons: collisions (probability low but non-zero), requires collision check.
3. **Random Base62:** Generate random 6-char string, check uniqueness in DB. Cons: DB check on every write.
4. **Pre-generated key pool:** Background service generates random keys in bulk, stores in a `keys_available` table. URL shortener service picks one from the pool. Avoids collision checking at write time. Scales cleanly with Zookeeper-based key distribution.

**Performance at 10B redirects/day = ~115K QPS:**
- Cache popular short URLs in Redis (`GET sho.rt/abc123 → original URL`). 90% of traffic is repeat redirects to popular URLs → cache hit rate very high.
- `301` vs `302`: Use `302` if you want to count every redirect (analytics), run A/B tests, or re-target the short URL to a different destination later. Use `301` if you want to reduce server load (browser caches the redirect).

### 77. Design a file storage system (like Dropbox or Google Drive)
"Dropbox/Google Drive: store files reliably, sync across devices, support sharing. Design for 1B users, exabytes of storage.

The key insight: **files are chunked**. Large files are split into 4MB chunks, hashed (SHA-256), and each chunk stored independently in a distributed object store (S3). Two files sharing a paragraph? That chunk is stored once — deduplication by content hash. Only changed chunks are uploaded on sync — delta sync.

Metadata (file names, folder structure, ownership, share permissions) goes to a relational DB (PostgreSQL + sharded MySQL). The sync service uses a vector clock or Lamport timestamp to detect conflicts when two devices modify the same file offline."

#### 🏢 Company Context
**Level:** 🔴 Senior | **Asked at:** Dropbox (their actual system!), Google, Microsoft, Box

#### Indepth
Dropbox's architecture:
- **Chunking + Deduplication:** Files split into content-defined chunks (Rabin fingerprinting — chunk boundaries at natural content breaks, not fixed byte positions). Each chunk identified by SHA-256 hash. Same chunk across multiple files = stored once. Client-side deduplication: before uploading chunk, check `POST /chunk/exists/{hash}`. If exists, skip upload — just reference it.
- **Block Server:** Receives chunks. Stores in S3. Records `{hash, s3_key}` in a block metadata DB.
- **Sync:** File changes detected by Dropbox desktop client file system watcher (inotify on Linux, FSEvents on macOS). Changed files rechunked, deltas computed, only changed chunks uploaded.
- **Vector Clocks for conflict detection:** Each device maintains a version vector. On sync, server compares. If two devices both modified the same file → conflict → both versions preserved (`file.txt` and `file (John's conflicted copy).txt`).
- **Notification system (for real-time sync):** Long polling or WebSocket from clients. Server pushes "file changed" notifications. Client pulls the delta of changed metadata.

### 78. Design a news feed (like Facebook)
"Facebook's News Feed is one of the most complex personalization systems ever built. At its core: when you open Facebook, you see a ranked, personalized feed of posts from friends, pages, and groups you follow.

The scale: 2B+ DAU, each user follows hundreds of friends/pages. Naively pulling posts from everyone you follow at read time is O(n * posts_per_friend) — way too slow. Facebook uses a hybrid fan-out: for normal users, pre-compute the feed and cache in Redis. Celebrities' posts are fetched at read time and merged.

The ranking is the hard part — Facebook trains massive ML models that predict "if user X sees post Y, will they react, comment, or share?" The top-scored posts form the feed."

#### 🏢 Company Context
**Level:** 🔴 Senior | **Asked at:** Meta (their core product), LinkedIn, Twitter, any social platform

#### Indepth
Facebook news feed pipeline:
1. **Candidate Generation:** Retrieve N candidates from:
   - Friends' recent posts (via social graph → last 24h posts for each friend)
   - Followed pages/groups
   - Sponsored content (ads)
   Total: thousands of candidates per user

2. **Filtering:** Remove already-seen posts, blocked users, reported content.

3. **Ranking:** ML model scores each candidate on: `P(engagement | user, post, context)`. Features: user-post relationship, historical engagement patterns, post freshness, media type. Light model (GBDT) for rough ranking → heavy model (DNN) for final top-k re-ranking.

4. **Diversity + Fairness:** Avoid showing 10 consecutive posts from same friend. Interleave content types. Apply content policies.

5. **Delivery + Caching:**
   - Computed feed stored in Redis list per user (top 500 posts as post_ids)
   - Feed pagination: user scroll → load next batch → trigger feed refresh computation for next page

**Facebook's EdgeRank (original algorithm) evolved into Neural News Feed Ranking (NNF) — a hundreds-of-features neural model, retrained daily on engagement signals.**

### 79. Design a video streaming service (like Netflix)
"Netflix serves 200M subscribers streaming HD/4K content concurrently. The challenge: serve different resolutions to users with different bandwidth, minimize startup latency, and eliminate buffering.

Architecture: content is **transcoded** once into dozens of formats (AVC, HEVC, AV1 codecs × multiple resolutions × multiple bitrates per resolution) and served via **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming** through a massive CDN (Netflix's own Open Connect CDN with servers in ISPs and IXPs globally). The player dynamically selects the best bitrate segment every few seconds.

The recommendation system (80% of what users watch comes from recommendations) is a hybrid collaborative filtering + content-based neural model, one of the most sophisticated in the industry."

#### 🏢 Company Context
**Level:** 🔴 Senior | **Asked at:** Netflix, Hotstar, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Jio Cinema

#### Indepth
Netflix's technical innovations:
- **Open Connect CDN:** Netflix doesn't use public CDNs like Cloudflare or Akamai (at scale). They partner with ISPs and IXPs to place Open Connect Appliances (OCAs) — dedicated servers pre-seeded with popular content. ~90% of Netflix traffic served from OCAs within the ISP's network. Zero internet transit cost.
- **Content Popularity Prediction:** Netflix knows which shows will spike (new season drop). They pre-seed OCAs with content before release — content pushed overnight to thousands of appliances.
- **Chaos Engineering:** Netflix's Chaos Monkey / Chaos Kong: kills EC2 instances, entire AZs, even entire AWS regions. If streaming still works, the resilience is proven. This started with "Chaos Monkey" and evolved into a chaos engineering practice.
- **Microservices at extreme scale:** Netflix has hundreds of microservices. API gateway (Zuul) handles client requests. Each service (title service, rating service, recommendation service) independently scalable. Hystrix circuit breakers prevent cascading failures.
- **A/B Testing at scale:** Netflix runs 1000s of A/B tests simultaneously — testing different AI-generated thumbnail images, UI flows, recommendation algorithms. A/B testing infrastructure is a first-class product.

### 80. Design an e-commerce platform (like Amazon)
"Amazon.com: product catalog (hundreds of millions of SKUs), search, cart, checkout, payment. The scale challenge during peak (Amazon Prime Day): orders at 100K/second.

Core microservices: **Product Service** (catalog, inventory), **Search Service** (Elasticsearch), **Cart Service** (Redis — sessions), **Order Service** (Postgres), **Payment Service** (idempotent, heavily tested), **Notification Service** (async).

The hardest part: **inventory management** at checkout. Two users can't buy the last item simultaneously. I use **optimistic locking** (try to decrement inventory, check version, retry if conflict) or **database row lock** (`SELECT FOR UPDATE`) to prevent overselling during the critical purchase flow."

#### 🏢 Company Context
**Level:** 🔴 Senior | **Asked at:** Amazon (they literally built this), Flipkart, Meesho, Myntra, Ajio

#### Indepth
E-commerce architecture deep dive:

**Product Catalog:**
- Structured data (category, price, brand) in MySQL/PostgreSQL
- Unstructured (descriptions, specifications) in DynamoDB or MongoDB
- Images in S3 + CloudFront CDN

**Search:**
- Elasticsearch with custom scoring: relevance × popularity × stock availability × personalization
- Typeahead: pre-computed suggestions in Redis sorted sets
- Faceted filtering: aggregation queries on ES

**Inventory at Scale:**
- Reservations pattern: request places a "soft hold" on inventory for 15 minutes during checkout. If payment succeeds, hold becomes a deduction. If payment fails or expires, hold is released.
- Flash sales (e.g., iPhone launches): overselling prevention with Redis atomic operations. `DECR inventory:product_id` — Redis is single-threaded, DECR is atomic. If result < 0 → `INCR` back and reject.

**Checkout flow (Saga):**
```
1. Validate cart items + prices (current snapshot)
2. Create order (PENDING) — local transaction
3. Reserve inventory → event: InventoryReserved
4. Charge payment → event: PaymentSuccess
5. Confirm order (CONFIRMED) → event: OrderConfirmed
6. Trigger fulfillment/shipping → event: FulfillmentStarted

If step 4 fails:
  Compensate step 3: ReleaseInventory
  Order status → PAYMENT_FAILED
```

**Why Amazon built DynamoDB:** During 2004 holiday season, Amazon's Oracle DB couldn't handle the load. Engineers built a proprietary system (Dynamo) optimized for Amazon's exact usage pattern. The 2007 Dynamo paper became one of the most influential distributed systems papers ever written.
