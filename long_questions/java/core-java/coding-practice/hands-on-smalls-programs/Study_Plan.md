You have a comprehensive collection of resources now. To effectively use them and ensure you are **100% ready**, follow this 7-day schedule.

## ✅ Phase 1: Logic & Coding Basics (Days 1-3)
**Goal**: clear the first round (Coding Round).
*   **Day 1**: Basic & Arrays
    *   Practice `01_Basic_Numbers.md` (Prime, Fib, Factorial).
    *   Practice `02_Arrays.md` (Sorting, Searching, Duplicates).
    *   *Target*: Be able to write these on paper without looking.
*   **Day 2**: Strings & Patterns
    *   Practice `03_Strings.md` (Palindrome, Anagram, Reversal).
    *   Practice `04_Patterns.md` (Star patterns - commonly asked to check loops).
*   **Day 3**: Collections & OOPs
    *   Practice `05_OOPs_Concepts.md` (Singleton, Inheritance).
    *   Practice `06_Collections.md` (HashMap iteration, ArrayList vs LinkedList).

## ✅ Phase 2: System Knowledge & Hands-on (Days 4-5)
**Goal**: Clear the technical discussion round ("Tell me about a time you built X").
*   **Day 4**: Mini-Projects (The "Hands-on" Experience)
    *   **Morning**: Build the `01_Banking_System` (Banking App) from scratch. Understand how `HashMap` is used like a database.

*   **Day 5**: Specialized Topics
    *   **JDBC**: Run the `04_JDBC_Connectivity` code. Connect to a real MySQL database.
    *   **Multithreading**: Understand `ExecutorService` in `05_Multithreading_Deep_Dive`.
    *   **JUnit**: Write one test case using `06_Unit_Testing_JUnit`.

## ✅ Phase 3: Advanced & Final Polish (Days 6-7)
**Goal**: Impress the interviewer and handle "Curveball" questions.
*   **Day 6**: Advanced Java
    *   Review `07_Advanced_Java.md` (Streams, Lambdas).
    *   Review `09_Design_Patterns.md` (Singleton, Factory).
*   **Day 7**: SQL & Final Revision
    *   Practice `08_SQL_Queries_for_Interview.md` (Write queries for Max Salary, Joins).
    *   **Mock Interview**: Pick random questions from the files and answer them aloud.
