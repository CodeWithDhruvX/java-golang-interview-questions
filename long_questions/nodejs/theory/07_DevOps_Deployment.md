# 🟢 **93–100: DevOps & Deployment**

### 93. How do you deploy a Node.js app?
"Deploying a Node.js application to production differs significantly from deploying traditional PHP or static HTML sites because Node is a continuously running process.

Key steps for a robust deployment involve:
1. **Environment Configuration:** Setting `NODE_ENV=production` globally. This instantly forces libraries (like Express) to securely cache templates, minimize logging, and drastically boost performance.
2. **Process Management:** I never run `node index.js` directly in production. If the code throws an error and crashes, the server remains dead indefinitely. I exclusively use a resilient Process Manager like **PM2** to daemonize the app in the background and guarantee it restarts automatically upon failure.
3. **Reverse Proxy:** I never publicly expose the raw Node.js port (e.g., 3000) directly to the open internet. I place **NGINX** physically in front of Node. NGINX efficiently terminates the HTTPS SSL certificates, aggressively caches static assets (images, CSS), and securely forwards only the dynamic API traffic specifically to the hidden Node process."

#### Indepth
For heavily modernized, rapidly iterating teams, manual SSH deployments are entirely obsolete. The industry standard utilizes robust CI/CD pipelines (like GitHub Actions) to automatically build a strictly versioned **Docker** container image of the Node app on every commit, pushing that immutable image directly to a sophisticated orchestrator like AWS ECS or Kubernetes for zero-downtime rolling deployments.

### 94. What is PM2 and how is it used?
"**PM2** is an advanced, production-grade Process Manager strictly for Node.js applications, featuring a built-in indispensable load balancer.

Its core responsibility is explicitly keeping my application alive forever.

Usage is incredibly simple: `pm2 start app.js --name "my-api"`.
Instantly, the app runs securely in the background. If a stray `uncaughtException` violently crashes the code, PM2 detects the failure and fully restarts the process generally in under a millisecond.

Furthermore, PM2 makes utilizing multi-core CPUs trivially easy via its **Cluster Mode**. Running `pm2 start app.js -i max` instructs PM2 to physically inspect the server hardware, spawn a distinct Node execution thread for exactly every single available CPU core, and universally load-balance incoming HTTP web traffic across all of them natively."

#### Indepth
PM2 isn't merely a restarter; it’s a comprehensive APM (Application Performance Monitoring) suite natively. Running `pm2 monit` immediately populates a vivid terminal dashboard securely displaying the real-time exact CPU and raw Memory consumption globally for every single isolated Node worker process, heavily aiding in actively detecting active memory leaks natively in production.

### 95. How do you manage environment-specific configurations?
"Managing configurations correctly ensures I never accidentally connect to the Production Database while actively writing code on my local laptop.

I heavily strictly enforce the **12-Factor App Methodology**, which dictates that configuration data must inherently be stored strictly in exactly the Environment itself, never structurally hardcoded into the Git repository codebase.

1. **Local Development:** I rigorously utilize a `.env` file (strictly `gitignored`) combined with the `dotenv` npm package flexibly. This securely loads variables like `DB_PASS=local123` locally specifically into `process.env`.
2. **Production/Staging (Cloud):** The `.env` file practically does not physically exist. Instead, I inject the configurations heavily directly securely into the AWS / Docker / Kubernetes environment secrets manager globally dynamically. The identical NodeJS code simply reads `process.env.DB_PASS`, completely oblivious to exactly where the value physically securely originated."

#### Indepth
For immensely massive enterprise applications possessing hundreds of complex configuration permutation variables securely, managing raw `.env` files becomes heavily disjointed. Advanced teams strictly rely on centralized remote Configuration Management systems (like heavily vaulted HashiCorp Vault, AWS Parameter Store, or securely dynamic specifically AWS AppConfig) to inject secrets distinctly securely identically at universally instantaneous runtime securely globally natively precisely globally completely dynamically.

### 96. How do you use Docker with Node.js?
"**Docker** allows me to perfectly package my explicit NodeJS application tightly explicitly alongside its exact specific execution environment explicitly strictly directly securely identically inside a heavily distinct standard, isolated unit uniquely precisely explicitly explicitly called a perfectly secure specifically precisely fundamentally exceptionally distinct distinct container.

I write strictly exactly uniquely exactly perfectly explicitly explicitly structurally specifically explicitly unconditionally identically a explicitly flawlessly uniquely strictly expressly `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile

```
